		<h3><br/>Non-profits for Community Surveillance</h3>
		<p>
			<br/>

			COVID-19 has a serious impact on the health and livelihood of the communities you serve.  The need of the hour is reliable data from the ground that supports the current relief activities, along with trusted, established channels that can relay critical information back to the communities (example treatment and testing centres, telephone counselling). 

			<br/><br/>
			If you are a non-profit organisation or a community-based organisation working directly with communities and are keen on action against COVID-19, please fill this form, takes 10 mins.  Being part of this collaboration will require community surveillance if called upon, and access to resources in the form of information and training that will support response to the COVID-19 threat in the communities you are engaged with. 
			<br/><br/>

			We want to hear from as many of you, so please disseminate widely.
			<br/><br/>
